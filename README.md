# Transfer Learning on CNNs

## Introduction
The following project provides a glimpse into the advantages of using transfer Learning when building convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The CNN built is trained to classify dog breeds based on image inputs and attempts to find a suitable model by analyzing different model architectures and employing transfer learning along the way.

Much of the work produced here was inspired by a Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree project which can be found [here](https://github.com/grantathon/dog_breed_image_classifier).
